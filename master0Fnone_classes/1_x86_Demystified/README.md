# Episode 1: x86 Assembly Demystified

## Class Objectives

- Walk through the Language Processing System that converts high-level code to assembly code to the machine code read by your processor, and all of the stages in-between
- Introduce several common features of x86/x64 assembly language and conventions
- Walk through a practice program demonstrating several common C programming structures and statements
- Reverse that practice program in Ghidra to practice identifying these structures and instructions
- Challenge you to take what you've learned and get yourself onto the "Wall of Fame" by finding the hidden flag in the included "CrackMe" program!
