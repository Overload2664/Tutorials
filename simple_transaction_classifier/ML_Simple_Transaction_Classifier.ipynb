    "This is my first toy project after spending a few COVID months getting a baseline understanding of machine learning using Python, scikit-learn, and pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a very simple credit card and banking transaction classification tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sharing it here:\n",
    "1. To encourage others to dive in to machine learning, because libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and others make ML more accessible (and fun) than ever before, especially to scrubs like me, and\n",
    "1. To gather feedback from SMEs and continously improve my approach, sharing those learnings with others\n",
    "\n",
    "### TL;DR\n",
    "My wife and I keep monthly budget sheets which include transactions to/from our bank account and various credit cards, and we use these to track spending across several categories so that we can see where our funds are going each month, and where we should cut/continue/invest.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, it is tedious to label each individual transaction, so I gathered ~a year's worth of labeled data and used this notebook to train an ML model which could auto-classify transactions for me, regardless of source account (bank or credit cards).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I can compute, analyze, and weep over our budget sheets in a matter of seconds every month (Great Success).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Details\n",
    "We use monthly budget sheets to track our finances by category of spending (e.g. groceries, gas, mortgage, dining out, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we did this by sitting down at the start of the month and manually labeling transactions from the last month of spending. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was tedious, and while some credit card/banking services offer this kind of \"tagging\" already, they all use different categories, and not always the same ones that would be most valuable to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted something more consistent, so we went through the tedium for a while, collecting all of the labeled data for about 13 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below Jupyter notebook - split into respective \"Pipelines\" of work - will walk through the process of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training a classifier from the year's worth of manually-labeled data\n",
    "1. Training a classifer from a continously-updated \"master\" set of data for future relearning\n",
    "1. Optimizing classifier parameters\n",
    "1. Classifying new, unlabeled data using the classifier\n",
    "1. Saving newly-labeled data to the master set, where it can be manually tweaked if inaccurate so that the classifier can be retrained\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation details will be discussed throughout the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes and Sharing Feedback\n",
    "* You will see certain data marked as \"REDACTED\" throughout the notebook - this is just data which contains location or PII about me or my personal accounts that I chose to omit from the project; It does not impact operations, but there are certain places where - if you choose to play with this notebook - you will have to tailor the notebook to your specific bank/credit card account data. I will highlight these.\n",
    "* I'm still an ML noob, so please share constructive feedback with me @jeFF0Falltrades on Twitter, or feel free to leave an Issue/PR on this GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks!"

    "1. The description of the transaction (provided by the bank/credit card CSV)\n",
    "1. The amount of the transaction (encoded using our intervals above)\n",
    "1. Whether the transaction is considered a debit or credit\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at these in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will preprocess the description text to remove superfluous characters, then remove unwanted transactions (see `IGNORED_TXN_TERMS` above), and then use [term frequency–inverse document frequency or TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) to encode the words in the description into a [sparse matrix](https://machinelearningmastery.com/sparse-matrices-for-machine-learning/#:~:text=A%20sparse%20matrix%20is%20a,of%20its%20coefficients%20are%20zero) of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, scikit-learn has an awesome prebuilt function for this - [`TfidfVectorizer()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, TF-IDF is used to weigh the importance of words across several documents or - in our case - transaction descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will analyze each \"word\" (which may not equate to an actual English word, so \"term\" or \"token\" can also be used) of the preprocessed transaction description and rank words that appear often in a particular description as more important in classifying that particular category of transaction, **unless** the term(s) also appear across other descriptions, in which case their importance is weighted less (terms like `\"USA\"` or `\"Charge\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of actual English \"words\", however, `TfidfVectorizer()` can be modified to use a range of n-grams, which essentially include any string of non-space characters (though this can be modified by tweaking various parameters of the function to define what a \"token\" should be considered, which \"stop words\" (common terms) should be filtered, and more).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given argument `ngram_range=(1,2)` (unigrams and bigrams) a description text like `\"marketplace credit charge us\"` will be vectorized to: `['marketplace', 'credit', 'charge' ,'us', 'marketplace credit', 'credit charge', 'charge us']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This vectorization will produce a sparse matrix which will be passed through to our classifier, so that it can learn which tokens/words in the transaction descriptions are associated with a particular category.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the tokens `\"Burger\"` and `\"Burger King\"` are very likely going to be strongly associated with the `\"Dining Out\"` category :-).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also make use of scikit-learn's built-in [`ColumnTransformer()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html) function, which makes it easy for us to run certain transformers (like `TfidfVectorizer`) on certain columns, and run different transformers - or just pass through \"as-is\", which we will do here - on remaining columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amount of the transaction\n",
    "Why go through the trouble of tracking the amount of the transaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to do this in order to increase the accuracy of the model, specifically finding it useful for the case when faced with transactions from the same shop/org, but in different increments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, sometimes, when I get fuel at a gas station when traveling, I'll also stop in to grab a drink or snack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these transaction descriptions will probably include the name of the gas station, but one will be smaller than the other (unless I'm **really** loading up on snacks for a long trip).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model might try to classify both of these as `\"Gas\"` based on the presence of the gas station name in the charge. \n",
    "\n",
    "But by including information about the charge amount, smaller charges will be recognized as `\"Groceries\"` (really, \"snacks\") and larger charges will be classified as `\"Gas\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction is Credit or Debit\n",
    "Once again, without including information about whether a transaction is a credit or debit, the model might learn to categorize both something I bought from Home Depot as `\"Household\"` as well as a refund on the same item if I later return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, I want these tracked as two different transactions: The debit as a `\"Household\"` transaction, and the refund as a `\"Refund\"` transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding in a feature to track which charges are debits or credits helps train our classifier to differentiate positive/negative charges appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a lot of background info for just a couple of lines of code, but hopefully it helps understand the approach!"

    "For classification, I'm going to use Linear Support Vector Classification, built into scikit-learn as [`LinearSVC()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "By definition, [Support Vector Machines](https://medium.com/axum-labs/logistic-regression-vs-support-vector-machines-svm-c335610a3d16) (SVMs) are supervised learning models which try to find a maximum *margin* between the line (in 2D space) or hyperplane (in 3D+ space) separating classes of items. By maximizing that margin, we can find the optimal separation of those classes of items (think of the classes as our \"categories\" of charges).\n",
    "\n",
    "The best ELI5 I've seen for SVMs is /u/copperking's [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15zrpp/please_explain_support_vector_machines_svm_like_i/), complete with helpful images.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two great blogs from [Georgios Drakos](https://gdcoder.com/support-vector-machine-vs-logistic-regression/) and [Lilly Chen](https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-simply-explained-fee28eba5496) that offer a primer on SVMs and how they compare to logistic regression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to settling on using `LinearSVC`, I ran tests with the following classifier algorithms built into scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regular SVC - `SVC()`\n",
    "* Logistic Regression  - `LogisticRegression()`\n",
    "* Random Forest - `RandomForestClassifier()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these can be wrapped in [`OneVsRestClassifier()` or `OneVsOneClassifier()`](https://machinelearningmastery.com/one-vs-rest-and-one-vs-one-for-multi-class-classification/) from scikit-learn for multi-class classification problems like the one we are solving here, though we would have to modify our y target values to be one-hot encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the cell at the bottom of this notebook for just such an example, with some tests of these classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I ultimately chose `LinearSVC()` because it trains quickly, scales well, and has a decent F1 score compared to the other classifiers I tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to evaluate scoring via the `f1_macro` metric due to the imbalance of classes/categories in this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see [here](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/40900/whats-the-difference-between-sklearn-f1-score-micro-and-weighted-for-a-mult) for a great explanation of various F1 metrics in scikit-learn, and [here](https://blog.exsilio.com/all/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures/) for an explanation of F1 Scoring in general, as well as other important scoring metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For my data set, I received some warnings along the lines of the below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these are due to some categories only being used once in the training dataset (for example `\"home down payment\"` is not really an oft-occurring category of transaction), which can impact how well the classifier can learn the features that define that category:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `UserWarning: The least populated class in y has only 1 members, which is less than n_splits=5`\n",
    "* `UserWarning: Label not (N) is present in all training examples.`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is okay, however - the classifier will still attempt to make a best prediction, and as time goes on and we gather more data, relabel misclassified data, and retrain our model, it will become more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will \"tune\" the hyperparameters of our TF-IDF Vectorizer and Linear SVC classifier using [`GridSearchCV()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html), another awesome built-in of scikit-learn which we can provide a range of values to test as parameters to our pipeline, and which will evaluate these parameters and output the best-performing model based on our scoring metric (F1 Macro).\n",
    "\n",
    "The current F1 score falls between the .65-.75 range - not fantastic, but I don't consider it too bad because I was less structured in how I categorized transactions early on, and so there are many categories that only appear once or a couple of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the model on 3 months of new, unlabeled data, I actually only had to relabel <2% of transactions which were classified incorrectly. "
